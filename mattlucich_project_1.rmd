### Load and preview chess data

```{r}

# Load data
cross_table <- read.delim('tournamentinfo.txt')

# Check type
typeof(cross_table)

# Preview data
head(cross_table,12)

```


### Helper function: Remove whitespace

This function removes leading and/or trailing whitespace from a string. It is used in the main conversion function, to_data_frame.

```{r}

remove_ws <- function(line_split) {
  # Initiate empty vector
  vector <- c()
   # Loop through split line
   for (i in line_split)  {
      # Remove leading and/or trailing whitespace 
      vector[i] <- trimws(i)
   }
  vector
}

```



### Helper function: Extract score

This function extracts the pre-rating score of the player from a string via regex and is used in the main conversion function, to_data_frame. The regular expression looks for a 3-4 digit number following "R:" and 1 to 2 characters (e.g. "R: 1393"). The following lines remove "R:" from the string, trim the whitespace, and convert to an integer.

```{r}

extract_score <- function(raw_string) {
  # Use regular expression to match to 3 to 4 digit number 1 to 2 characters from "R:"
  clean_str <- str_extract(raw_string, "(R:.)(.{1,2}[0-9]{3,4})")
  # Remove "R:"
  clean_str <- str_replace(clean_str, "R:", "")
  # Remove leading and/or trailing whitespace 
  clean_str <- trimws(clean_str)
  # Convert from string to integer
  clean_str <- as.integer(clean_str)
  clean_str
}

```



### Helper function: Extract opponent

This function extracts the player number from a string via regex and is used in the main conversion function, to_data_frame. The regular expression looks for a 1-2 digit number. **Note**, the regular expression will need to be updated if player numbers exceed two digits.

```{r}

extract_opponent <- function(raw_string) {
  # Use regular expression to match to 1 to 2 digit number
  clean_str <- str_extract(raw_string, "[0-9]{1,2}")
  clean_str
}

```



### Clean and convert data into dataframe

This is the main data cleaning and conversion function which at a high-level creates a dataframe with four out of the five attributes needed for this project, plus the player's opponents numbers. First, the function initiates a dataframe with dummy data that will be removed later. Second, the function loops through the dataframe in 3 row increments. While in the loop, various data is extracted and cleaned, then added to the dataframe.

```{r}

to_data_frame <- function(cross_table) {
   # Initiate dataframe with dummy data which will be removed later
   df_players <- tibble("name" = "temp", "state" = "te", "points" = 1, 
                     "prerating" = 1, "opponents" = "")
   # Loop through the dataframe in 3 row increments
   for (i in seq(4, nrow(cross_table), by = 3))  {
      # Split the two lines for each player using pipes as the seperator
      line_split_one <- str_split(cross_table[(i):(i+1),][1], "\\|")
      line_split_two <- str_split(cross_table[(i):(i+1),][2], "\\|")
      # Remove whitespace
      line_clean_one <- remove_ws(line_split_one)
      line_clean_two <- remove_ws(line_split_two)
      # Add row to dataframe with player's name, state, points, pre-rating, and opponent player numbers
      df_players <- df_players %>% add_row("name" = str_to_title(line_clean_one[[2]], locale = "en"), 
                        "state" = line_clean_two[[1]], 
                        "points" = as.numeric(line_clean_one[[3]]), 
                        "prerating" = extract_score(line_clean_two[[2]]), 
                        "opponents" = paste(
                                      toString(extract_opponent(line_split_one[[1]][[4]])),
                                      toString(extract_opponent(line_split_one[[1]][[5]])), 
                                      toString(extract_opponent(line_split_one[[1]][[6]])),
                                      toString(extract_opponent(line_split_one[[1]][[7]])),
                                      toString(extract_opponent(line_split_one[[1]][[8]])),
                                      toString(extract_opponent(line_split_one[[1]][[9]])),
                                      toString(extract_opponent(line_split_one[[1]][[10]])),
                                      sep = ", "))
   }
   # Set as a dataframe and remove extraneous rows
   df_players <- as.data.frame(df_players)
   df_players <- df_players %>% slice(2:n())
}

df_chess <- to_data_frame(cross_table)
head(df_chess, 12)

```



### Preperation for calculating average pre chess rating of opponents

Add player_num column and create opp_pre (average opponent pre-rating score) column with temporary data.

```{r}

# Turn index into player_num column
df_chess <- cbind(player_num = rownames(df_chess), df_chess)
rownames(df_chess) <- 1:nrow(df_chess)
df_chess['opp_pre']= 0

```


### Calculate average pre chess rating of opponents

This function calculates the average pre chess rating of opponents for each player. While looping through the dataframe one row at a time each opponents cell is converted into a list, which is used to filter for only the rows containing the current player's opponents. The prerating_opp sum is calculated, then divided by the number of games played (i.e. byes, forfeits, recored as NAs, are not included). **Note**, R's base round function rounds down positive .5 values; anything above .5 is rounded up.

```{r}

cal_avg_pre_opp_rating <- function(df_chess) {
  for (i in 1:nrow(df_chess))  {
    # Split opponents string by comma
    opp_list <- as.list(strsplit(df_chess[i, ]$opponents, ",\\s"))
    # Convert list of strings to list of numeric values
    opp_list <-as.numeric(opp_list[[1]])
    # Filter for only opponents
    prerating_opp <- subset(df_chess, player_num %in% opp_list)
    # Set opp_pre cell value with calculated average rounded to nearest full-point
    df_chess[i, 7] = round(sum(prerating_opp$prerating) / length(prerating_opp$prerating), digits = 0)
  }
  df_chess
}

df_final <- cal_avg_pre_opp_rating(df_chess)

```


### Write to CSV


```{r}

# Drop opponent column
df_final <- subset(df_final, select = -c(player_num, opponents))
head(df_final, 12)

# Write to CSV
write.csv(df_final, "chess_players_final.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```
